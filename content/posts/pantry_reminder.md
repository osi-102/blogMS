## Executive Summary

Every year, households and businesses waste billions of dollars’ worth of food while millions struggle with medication adherence. Our dual-app concept—**The Pantry Expiry Tracker** paired with **"Did I Take My Meds?" Voice Tracker**—aims to tackle these pervasive issues using smart technology. By leveraging barcode scanning, cloud analytics, and voice integration, our apps help users manage their pantries efficiently and ensure timely medication intake. This case study outlines the problem, validates it with compelling statistics, compares current solutions, and details our market differentiation, technical implementation, and marketing strategy.

## 1. The Problem

### Food Waste Crisis

- **Global Impact:** According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately **one-third of all food produced for human consumption (1.3 billion tonnes)** is wasted each year.
- **Household Level:** Studies indicate that **up to 40% of food purchased in developed countries is thrown away**, costing households hundreds of dollars annually.
- **Environmental Cost:** Food waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, as decomposing food in landfills releases methane—a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide.

### Medication Non-Adherence

- **Health Risks:** The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that **medication non-adherence accounts for nearly 50%** of treatment failures for chronic diseases.
- **Economic Impact:** In the U.S. alone, non-adherence is estimated to cost over **$100 billion** in additional healthcare expenses every year.
- **Quality of Life:** Forgetting to take medications can lead to severe health consequences, especially for the elderly and individuals with complex treatment regimens.

## 2. Market Analysis and Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions for Food Waste Management

- **NoWaste:** Offers simple inventory tracking for fridges and pantries but is limited in terms of predictive analytics and automation.
- **Eat By:** Focuses on expiration alerts but lacks features such as barcode scanning, detailed waste analytics, and integration with meal-planning suggestions.
- **Our Differentiator:**  
  - **Barcode-Centric Approach:** Automatically fetch product information using databases like Open Food Facts, reducing manual entry errors.
  - **Waste Analytics:** Provides monetary insights (e.g., “You’ve saved $43 this month”) and actionable data that encourage responsible shopping.
  - **Meal Suggestions:** Offers recipes based on items nearing expiry, transforming potential waste into a valuable resource.

### Existing Solutions for Medication Adherence

- **MediSafe:** Uses reminders and simple logs but lacks voice integration and caregiver access.
- **MyTherapy:** Combines medication tracking with health data but often requires manual input.
- **Our Differentiator:**  
  - **Voice-First Interface:** Allows users to log medication with simple voice commands (“I took my 8 AM meds”) via Alexa or Google Home.
  - **Caregiver Integration:** Enables family members to monitor adherence remotely, which is especially beneficial for the elderly.
  - **Customizable Reminders:** Adapts to personal medication schedules with adaptive alerts for missed doses.
